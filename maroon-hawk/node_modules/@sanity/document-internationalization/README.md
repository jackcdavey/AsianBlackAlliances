## What this plugin solves

There are two popular methods of internationalization in Sanity Studio:

- **Document-level translation**
  - A unique document version for every language
  - Joined together by references and/or a predictable `_id`
  - Best for documents that have unique, language-specific fields and no common content across languages
  - Best for translating content using Portable Text
- **Field-level translation**
  - A single document with many languages of content
  - Achieved by mapping over languages on each field, to create an object
  - Best for documents that have a mix of language-specific and common fields
  - Not recommended for Portable Text

This plugin adds features to the Studio to improve handling **document-level translations**.

- A Language Selector to create and browse language-specific versions of each Document
- Document Actions to update base and translated documents to ensure references stay in tact
- Document Badges to highlight the language version of a document

For **field-level translations** you should use the [@sanity/language-filter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/language-filter).

### Many projects use both!

An example of document-level translation could be a `lesson` schema, the `title`, `slug` and `content` fields would be unique in every language.

A good use of field-level translation could be a `person` schema. It could have the same `name` and `image` in every language, but only the `biography` would need translating.

## Installation

With the [Sanity CLI installed](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli), from the same directory as the Studio run:

```
sanity install @sanity/document-internationalization
```

Ensure that `@sanity/document-internationalization` is listed in `plugins` inside `sanity.json`.

The plugin is now installed, but you will need to complete the following steps to see the Document Translation UI:

# Asian Black Alliance

Welcome to the Asian Black Alliance website repo! The website can be accessed at AsianBlackAlliance.org, where you can learn more about the project and our team's research thus far. Below is a guide for setting up local development of the ABA website, built with NextJS, Sanity CMS, and Typescript.

#### Before starting, you should have Node.JS, NPM, and Homebrew (if MacOs) installed. 

### 1. Clone the Repo
Use either the GitHub web GUI or the CLI with ```gh repo clone jackcdavey/AsianBlackAlliances``` to locally save the repo, and unzip in your development location.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Using the command line to navigate into the project folder, run ```npm install``` to download and install all necessary dependencies for the project

### 3. Run the Project
From the project root directory, run ```npm run dev``` to start the website on port 3000. If a browser window does not automatically open, you can view the site at ```localhost:3000```

#### Sanity-based site content will not load on unrecognized IPs, which will result in missing text and images. Please reach out either directly or through the website contact form if you need to be added for development purposes.
